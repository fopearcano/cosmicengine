# CosmicEngine

CosmicEngine is a data-driven, physics-grounded, AI-assisted cosmic perception engine.

## Future modules

- `engine` — deterministic universe state
- `renderer` — photon-field and warp viewer
- `ai` — neural renderer experiments
- `data_pipeline` — catalog ingestion

## Current status

- Phase 1 core object model implemented (`TruthLevel`, `CosmicObjectType`, `Vector3`, `UniverseObject`, `UniverseRegistry`).
- Time system (`SimulationClock`, Julian-Date helpers), units, and RA/Dec ↔ Cartesian coordinates.
- No simulation, rendering, or AI yet.

## Phase 2: Data ingestion

- Basic CSV star catalog loader implemented (`cosmic_engine.data`).
- Supports RA/Dec → Cartesian conversion and distance in light-years.
- Registry integration available via `load_star_catalog_into_registry`.
- Sample catalog at `data/sample_stars.csv`; demo at `examples/load_star_catalog_demo.py`.

## Phase 3: Photon field projection

- CosmicEngine can now convert catalog stars into photon samples
  (`SimpleCamera`, `PhotonSample`, `build_star_photon_field`).
- Basic plain-PPM starfield export implemented
  (`render_photon_field_to_ppm`); demo at `examples/render_starfield_demo.py`
  (writes `examples/output_starfield.ppm`).
- Still no AI, GPU, relativity, or advanced rendering.

## Phase 4: Perception transform

- Deterministic, relativistic-inspired perception layer implemented
  (`cosmic_engine.perception`): `ObserverState` carries pose, velocity,
  and a `warp_factor` knob; `transform_photon_field` applies
  aberration-like direction compression, beaming-like brightness
  scaling, and a simple Doppler-flavored blue/red color shift.
- `warp_factor >= 1.0` extends perception beyond the physical regime
  for visualization; superluminal velocities are rejected.
- Demo at `examples/perception_warp_demo.py` writes
  `output_warp_{1,5,50}.ppm`.
- Still deterministic and AI-free.

## Phase 5: AI-assisted perception

- AI warp layer introduced (`cosmic_engine.ai`): `AIWarpModel` base
  class defines the pluggable interface (`predict_direction`,
  `predict_brightness`, `predict_color`, `confidence`); future
  PyTorch / ONNX / JAX models will implement it.
- Currently ships with a deterministic placeholder
  (`SimpleNeuralWarp`) that stands in for a real model so the rest of
  the pipeline is exercisable today.
- `transform_photon_field(samples, observer, ai_model=None)` routes to
  the deterministic path when `ai_model` is `None`. The deterministic
  fallback is always available and remains the default.
- Demo at `examples/ai_warp_demo.py` writes
  `output_ai_{off,on,extreme}.ppm`.
